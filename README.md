# **Render time calculator**
As the name says this tool allows you to calculate an approximative total render duration.
This might be useful for tools/programs like Blender for example.

## How to use it
Clone or download the repository to your computer.
Open either `HTML.html` or `AllInOne.html`.
Once you have one of the files open in your browser, simply fill out the forms, and that's it.

------------

The differences are; that the `AllInOne.html` has everything it needs in it, so you just need to copy/download this file, and don't need the CSS, nor, the JavaScript file, at the cost of readability in the code.
